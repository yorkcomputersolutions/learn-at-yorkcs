[Phaser][1] is one of the most popular HTML5 game frameworks. It uses modern web technologies that allow for creating epic cross-browser games. In this tutorial series, we will be covering the basics of Phaser 3! This series will cover everything needed to make a basic game. Some of the concepts we will be covering include:

  * Setting up a simple development environment
  * Loading images, sounds, and TrueType fonts
  * Adding sprites
  * Changing positions
  * Setting velocity and acceleration
  * Simple collisions
  * Basic sprite effects
  * Playing sounds
  * Particles

The goal of this series is to break down these concepts into small, manageable parts.
