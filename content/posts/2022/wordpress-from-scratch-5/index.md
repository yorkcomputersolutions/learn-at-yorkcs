## The WordPress Dashboard
The WordPress dashboard is the place to manage everything pertaining to your website.  It can only be accessed after logging in.

## Homepage
The homepage is the first page that appears when you install WordPress and login to WordPress.

## Updates
The _Updates_ page is the place to go for updating WordPress core, theme, and any plugins you have.

## Posts
The _Posts_ page is the place to go for managing your posts.  When you navigate to the _Posts_ tab, you will see all of the posts you've created including drafts.  To edit a post, click the title of the post you wish to edit. 

## Media
The _Media_ tab on the left sidebar is home to the _Media Library_.  The Media Library is the place where all your media on your website can be managed.

## Pages
Much like the _Posts_ page, the _Pages_ page allows you to manage the pages of your website.  Just like the _Posts_ page, you can click the title of a page to edit it.

## Comments
You can manage the comments on your website on the _Comments_ page.

## Appearance
If you click on the _Appearance_ tab, you will be directed to the _Themes_ page.

### Themes
The themes page allows you to manage your themes.  You can click the blue _Customize_ button on your active theme to manage customization options through the _Customizer_.  You can also delete the themes you aren't currently using by clicking on them, and clcking the _Delete_ button in the bottom-right corner of the overlay.  You can also install a new theme by clicking the _Add New Theme_ button.  Doing so will open a page where you can search for new themes.  At the top of the page, you can also sort by popular themes, the latest themes, as well as favorites you've marked.  You can even filter themes by specific features which you can specify under the _Feature Filter_ button.

### Customize
The _Customize_ subtab opens the WordPress _Customizer_.

### Widgets
The _Widgets_ page is the spot to manage the various widgets that are on your website.

### Menus
The _Menus_ page allows you to create menus to be displayed by your theme.  This page is most commonly used for configuring the primary (usually shown in the site header), secondary, and footer menus.

### Theme Editor
While not the recommended way to edit your theme, it can work in an absolute pinch.  You might consider using the Theme Editor if there is a conflict your theme is causing and you want to make a bandage fix.

## Plugins
The plugins page displays a list of the plugins you have installed, whether active or non-active.  You can activate and deactivate plugins by clicking the respective link under the title of a given plugin.  Many plugins also provide access to their settings with a _settings_ link next to the Activate/Deactivate link.  Of course, you can view various details including the description, author, and version of each plugin on the right side of the listing.

## Users
The _Users_ page is the place to add, edit, and remove users from your website.  I will cover the Users page in detail in a later _WordPress from Scratch_ guide.

## Tools
WordPress provides one tool by default, _Categories and Tags Converter_.  You can access this tool by clicking the _Categories and Tags Converter_ link in the box displayed.  You will then be directed to the Import screen.

## Settings
The _Settings_ page contains all of the general settings related to your website.  Here are the various options you can edit on this screen:
- Site Title
    - The title of your website.  Shown in search results and on the tab label.  This may also be shown in the header/footer of the theme you use.
- Tagline
    - Tagline of your website.  This is shown in search results next to your title.  This can be left empty if you don't care to display a tagline.
- WordPress Address (URL)
- Site Address (URL)
- Administration Email Address
    - The email address where WordPress notifications are sent to including site issues, new user registrations, user changing their password, etc.
- Membership
    - Whether or not visitors can register.
- New User Default Role
    - The role new users are assigned as by default.
- Site Language
    - The language of your website.
- Timezone
    - The timezone that times on your website should be shown in.
- Date Format
    - The date format that dates are displayed in.
- Time Format
    - The time format that times are displayed in.
- Week Starts On
    - The day WordPress considers as the start of the week.

## How to Log out of Your Website
To log out, hover over the _Howdy, <your name> button in the top-right corner on the top bar.  In the dropdown, click the _Log Out_ button.

## How to Log in to Your Website
To log in, navigate to _your domain name_/wp-login.php.  Then, fill in your username and password, then click the blue _Log In_ button.

## In Conclusion
Hopefully this guide has been helpful in providing an overview of the WordPress dashboard.
