Before you can start a website, WordPress or otherwise, you will need a domain.  Perhaps you're wondering why you need a domain name.  A domain name allows other people around the world to access your website by an eas(ier) to use name.  Think of a domain name kind of like an address you send mail to.

Organizations that sell domains are known as _domain registrars_.  I use Namecheap myself and have found them to be quite reliable.  Most domain registrars make it relatively easy to buy a domain.

You will need to renew your domain each year, so perhaps the word "buy a domain" isn't very accurate.  It is the word most people use, though.  

Please find a domain you like and "buy" it.  I will cover linking the domain to the hosting provider we go with in the next part of this series.
