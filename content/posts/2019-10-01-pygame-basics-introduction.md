We all know Python is highly flexible. What many don&#8217;t know is that you can create awesome games with a library called, [PyGame][1]. PyGame is a cross-platform set of game development modules for Python. This series is meant to help you learn the basics of PyGame, and is written so you don&#8217;t have to follow every part in order. Think of the [PyGame Basics][2] series as a reference, and not necessarily a step-by-step walk-through of each part (though you could read each part in order.)

Here are handful of some of the concepts we will be covering:

  * Adding sprites and images
  * Changing positions
  * Using custom fonts
  * Utilizing input
  * Adding sounds
  * And more!

You can view all the parts we&#8217;ve published so far, [here][2]. If you would like to receive news regarding future tutorials and courses we write, you can subscribe to our [newsletter][3]. Sharing this tutorial series on your favorite social media platform would also be much appreciated.
