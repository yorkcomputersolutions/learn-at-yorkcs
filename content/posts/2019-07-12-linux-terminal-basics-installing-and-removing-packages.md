Hey there! In this guide, we will be taking a look at how to install and remove packages via the terminal!

To begin, let&#8217;s start by opening the terminal. I have covered how to open the terminal in the last couple parts of this series. If you haven&#8217;t read them, I would recommend checking out [part one][1] and [two][2].

Once you&#8217;ve opened your terminal, let&#8217;s try installing an application. Applications are made up of what are known as _packages_ in Linux. Let&#8217;s just say we wanted to install VLC player. Not a problem! Type the following:

_sudo apt-get install vlc_

We can&#8217;t install packages by default as a normal user. This is why we need to run the command as a _super user_. We can specify this via adding _sudo_ before the command. Press &#8216;enter&#8217;, then type your password when it prompts you. If you don&#8217;t see your password as you type, that&#8217;s normal, don&#8217;t worry about it. Once you press &#8216;enter&#8217; again, there will be another prompt asking if you want to install the list of packages it found.

If we press &#8216;y&#8217;, then hit &#8216;enter&#8217;, we should see the installation proceed.

See the cursor? Fantastic! Now you can install and remove packages from the terminal! You are on your way to becoming a pro at this.
